title: Network transport timing
summary: Measures each private link and schedules retries without changing synchronized frame timing.

Each private connection maintains smoothed round trip, variation, and a retry
timeout. Acknowledgements of first transmissions are the measurements. Until a
link has one, its first acknowledgement seeds a provisional estimate even after
a retry, so a link slower than the initial retry delay becomes measurable; the
first clean acknowledgement replaces the seed. In a compressed game, a frame
packet requests an acknowledgement at least every 32 frames while any link
still lacks a clean measurement, so a quiet player's links are measured
before the first timing evaluations.

The retry timeout is limited to 100–4000 ms. Repeated private transmissions
double their wait up to the connection timeout. For a measured link, the
connection timeout is the larger of eight times the smoothed round trip plus
250 ms and four times the current retry timeout, bounded to 2–30 seconds.
This lets the first retry wait for the backed-off timeout while allowing at
least three transmissions before the connection timeout.

A packet older than the connection timeout marks the connection bad but keeps
retrying until acknowledged. Receive-queue cleanup continues during these
retries, freeing space for the backlog when the link recovers. An unmeasured
link uses the bounded legacy timing, and global lobby traffic keeps its fixed
cadence.

A retransmitting link also doubles the timeout it measures against, once per
retransmission proven against the current value. Without that, a link whose
latency has risen above its timeout retransmits every packet before its
acknowledgement arrives and never yields an unambiguous sample. The next clean
acknowledgement recomputes the timeout from the measured latency; until then the
estimate keeps its last measured value while pacing retries.
